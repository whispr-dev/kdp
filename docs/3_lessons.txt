3 Crucial Lessons My Creative Writing School Never Taught Me
I learned it by doing.

For two years, I attended a creative writing school where I learned valuable skills and honed my craft. However, looking back, there were three essential lessons that were completely overlooked during my time there. These lessons — ones I had to teach myself over the years — have become the cornerstones of my writing journey. Here’s what my writing school missed, and why mastering these points is crucial for any aspiring writer.


Self-Publishing
In school, the focus was entirely on traditional publishing, with self-publishing barely mentioned. Why? Because all the instructors came from the traditional publishing industry.

I can’t stress this enough: if you’re serious about writing, you must explore self-publishing. In my experience, the world of publishing is often more about appearance than substance. Sure, big publishing houses dominate bookstore shelves, and yes, it can be hard to achieve that level of visibility as a self-published author. But unless you’re Ken Follett or Brandon Sanderson, your chances of becoming a bestseller through a publisher are pretty slim.

Then, there’s the issue of time. Traditional publishing moves at a snail’s pace. While a colleague of mine spent a year searching for a publisher — ultimately with no success — I wrote and published four books.

Had I gone through a publisher for those four books, they would have taken half the earnings. And let’s not forget that many publishers today have zero marketing budgets, expecting authors to promote their own work.

So, what’s the point of having a publisher’s logo on my cover if I’m doing all the work? Something doesn’t add up.

At least as a self-published author, I keep all the profits from my hard work.

Social Media Skills for Authors
Believe it or not, social media skills need to be learned. While “learning by doing” is fine, it’s important to develop a few key skills to avoid getting lost in the chaos.

1. Choosing Your Platform
When starting out as an author on social media, do yourself a favor and focus on just one or two platforms. After all, your main goal is to maximize your writing time. Find the platform that resonates with you the most and start building a community there — not just a following.

2. Community vs. Followers
A community has a certain dynamic. “Go with the flow” is a great way to describe it. Stay observant and figure out what your audience cares about, what they respond to, and which topics interest them. Engage authentically and remain true to yourself.

3. Political Statements
In my experience, it’s wise to show restraint when it comes to political statements. Your primary goal is to build a readership and get your novels and stories in front of people. While political opinions might attract a few readers, you’re more likely to alienate a larger group whose views differ from yours.
Always remember: art and politics don’t usually go hand in hand.

Book Marketing
Book marketing doesn’t happen on its own, and it certainly doesn’t happen overnight. It’s hard work that requires both time and money. Here’s a list of marketing strategies and helpful resources I wish I’d known about sooner:

Newsletter Advertising
There are plenty of newsletter services where you can promote your book deals. They can help you reach a targeted audience interested in new releases and special offers.

Amazon Ads
If you don’t want to manage Amazon ads yourself, many professionals on Fiverr offer their services to help you set up and run effective campaigns. It’s a good option if you’d rather focus on writing than advertising.

Kindlepreneur
Kindlepreneur is packed with useful tips and tricks for marketing your book. If you plan to promote your book on Amazon yourself, it’s worth investing in the Publisher Rocket app, which can help you optimize your book for better visibility.

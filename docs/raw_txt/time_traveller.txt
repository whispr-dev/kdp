A Time Traveler’s Notebook
"We never really go back. We just circle closer to the moments we couldn't leave behind."

Entry 1 — The Constant Now
The machine was modest. Not like the cinematic chrome leviathans or spinning wormholes of theory, but a black box no bigger than a shoebox, with a faint blue hum and a rotary dial—each tick worth five seconds. The genius who built it, Dr. Ilya Vargos, didn’t wear a lab coat or goggles. He preferred sweaters and notebooks, and he talked to himself more than to people.

The theory was sound. Entropy could be teased, not reversed, but coaxed like smoke curling back into a cigarette. But only briefly. Push too far, and the probability curves would tangle, or the machine would burn out. So Ilya could never go back days or years—only seconds or minutes. Just enough to nudge time.

Just enough, he hoped, to save his sister.

Entry 4 — The Spark
She died on a Tuesday.

Her name was Aria. She called him "Yaya" when she was small, even when she was grown, even when she left him voicemails he never listened to until after the crash. Until the police lights outside. Until the hallway of the hospital reeked of antiseptic and formal apologies.

The accident was stupid. A lit stove, a missed call, a spilled mug of tea, and a short in the wiring. A moment. One moment. If he could rewind just that—

The first test rewound twenty seconds. He watched a fly uncross its legs. His coffee grew hotter. The pain in his chest eased for the first time in months.

He wrote:
Time is not a river. It’s an echo that we can only chase, not catch.

Entry 9 — Fifteen Seconds
He tried to warn her.

He turned the dial. Fifteen seconds back. Called her phone.

She answered—but it was too early. “Yaya? I’m about to make tea, what’s up?”

Panicked, he hung up. He tried again—this time, twenty-five seconds. The phone rang endlessly. She never answered.

When he went to her apartment the next day, everything was slightly wrong. A different painting on the wall. A voicemail he didn’t remember leaving, where he stammered about kettles and circuits. She hadn’t listened to it.

He tried again.

Entry 17 — A Hundred Tries
Each jump back was like skipping a stone across a pond. Every ripple changed something he hadn’t meant to change.

She didn’t pick up the phone. She spilled something else. She didn’t die in the fire—but she died in a car crash hours later. Or choked on something. Or slept through her alarm and never made it to her next gig.

The universe, it seemed, did not like interference.

And yet, he couldn’t stop.

Entry 21 — The Living Ghost
Ilya began keeping the notebook because memory was becoming unreliable. Each reset rethreaded the world subtly—different radio songs, different headlines, different people standing at crosswalks.

He stopped recognizing himself in mirrors.

Sometimes Aria survived for days before something else happened. Once, she made it two weeks. They even had coffee together.

He told her everything. The machine. The jumps. The failures.

She just smiled, a sad little twist of the mouth.

“You’re stuck, Yaya. Like a scratched record trying to skip back to the chorus.”

He tried not to cry. He didn’t remember the last time anyone had called him that.

Entry 29 — When the Cat Didn’t Move
He watched a stray cat in the alley below his lab window. He had watched it many times before, always bounding across the dumpster lid around 4:37 p.m. This time, it didn’t.

He had jumped back too many times. Time was tiring. Fracturing.

His machine sputtered.

His nose bled.

He saw two moons in the sky, for a moment.

The notebook's lines warped when he wrote.

Entry 33 — What He Could Not Change
He stopped jumping.

He left the machine unplugged and buried the rotary dial in a jar of honey.

He walked.

He remembered her voice—not the moment she died, not the sounds of sirens—but her laugh when she spilled curry on his blueprints, or the way she danced terribly to 90s pop songs in socks.

He sat at her grave and read from the notebook.

He had filled 88 pages.

Some entries were pure equations. Some were apologies. Some were nonsense written during time tremors.

But some were just this:

"I can’t fix the past. But I can carry you with me. I choose to walk forward."

Final Entry — Afterlight
He sold the lab. Burned the blueprints.

Moved to a little village in Portugal where time passed gently and the wind didn’t ask questions.

He taught local kids how to build radios from scrap. Sometimes he watched sunsets for hours. Once in a while, he still whispered her name.

The notebook sat on a shelf, its cover worn, its pages faded.

On the last page, a single line, written in the margin with a trembling hand:

"The smallest moments are the ones that matter. And you can't time-travel to them. You just have to live them right the first time."

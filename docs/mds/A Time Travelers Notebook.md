## Prologue

We never really go back. We just circle closer to the moments we couldn't leave behind.


---

## Chapter 1 — The Man Who Wouldn’t Blink

Ilya Vargos lived alone in a building that had once been a print shop. Ink still bled through the cracks in the floor, stained reminders of forgotten newspapers and discarded flyers. The upstairs had been converted into a living space—bare except for bookshelves and dust—and the basement was where the real work happened.

Not work that paid. No one had employed Dr. Vargos in years. After publishing three physics papers so advanced even he couldn’t get them peer-reviewed, he’d quietly disappeared from academia. Some said he’d gone mad. Others claimed he was secretly working for a defense agency.

Only the stray cats and the postwoman knew the truth: Ilya Vargos had been chasing time.

The machine sat in the middle of the basement, cradled in a nest of wires and copper coils. It didn’t look like much. A matte black box, about the size of a lunch pail, with a dial on one side and a single glass light that pulsed blue when powered on.

It had no name.

The notebook, however, did.

Bound in cracked leather and filled with looping, meticulous script, it was titled simply:

Time Traveler’s Notes: Attempts 1–∞

The first page bore a single quote:

“What is time? If no one asks me, I know. If I wish to explain it to him who asks, I do not.”
— Saint Augustine

Ilya had underlined I know and I do not.

He sat cross-legged beside the machine, staring at it like a priest at confession. His fingers hovered above the dial. His jaw tightened.

He didn’t want to go back.

He had to.

It wasn’t for glory or knowledge. It was for one burned letter, one voice in a voicemail, one kitchen fire.

One moment. One girl. One name.

Aria.

He turned the dial: three clicks. Fifteen seconds.

The blue light flared.

The notebook flapped open on its own.

The world rippled.

---

## Chapter 2 — Echoes and Ashes

The first thing that returned was the scent.

Jasmine.

For a half-breath after the jump, the stale air of the basement gave way to the perfume Aria always wore, subtle and earthy and utterly her. It vanished before he could inhale again, like memory pressed between book pages too long.

Ilya sat still. The hum of the machine quieted, and the light dimmed to a glow. On the table beside him, a digital clock blinked 17:23:09, then 17:22:54.

Fifteen seconds peeled back.

He reached for the notebook. Page 48. Attempt 117.

Result: clock reset. Spoon back on table. Fly reappears midair. Radio resumes earlier phrase (“…and that’s why they call it—”). Minor nausea. Success. No visible entropy displacement.

There was no mention of Aria. Not in this attempt.

He closed the notebook and leaned back against the wall, eyes on the ceiling.

“Yaya,” she used to say, “do you think time moves the same for trees?”

They’d been kids, lying on their backs beneath the plum tree in their grandmother’s yard. Aria’s hair had been full of petals, her fingernails painted sky-blue with little constellations scratched on.

He’d told her the answer was no—that trees operated on longer rhythms. He’d even explained chloroplasts and seasonal hormone cycles.

She’d yawned halfway through, poked his cheek, and said, “Sometimes I think you talk in math to hide the soft parts.”

He didn’t deny it. Even then.

He’d been giving a lecture in Zurich when it happened. Quantum thermodynamics. He still remembered the equations on the whiteboard, how neat they were. How certain.

The call came mid-slide. Unknown number.

He silenced it.

Later, the voicemail had waited like a landmine in his inbox. He never opened it. Not until hours later, when the call came again—this time from a police officer.

Her apartment had caught fire.

A faulty kettle, they said. Something shorted. Steam, heat, oil, timing.

She died inhaling smoke before anyone reached her.

Attempt 2: Tried setting clock back by 10 seconds. Dropped pencil lands back in hand. Felt mild vertigo. Notebook flips page as if wind present. Noticed sound stutter in song playing. No change to events beyond lab.

Attempt 5: Attempted to call Aria mid-jump. Voicemail picked up. Different message than remembered.

Attempt 11: Traveled 45 seconds prior. Arrived in street near her building. Different man walking dog. Same cloud formation. Aria didn’t answer door. Police tape already up.

He had begun with science.

He had continued with obsession.

Now it was just grief dressed as precision.

Ilya stood slowly, legs stiff. He moved toward the corkboard he’d bolted to the far wall. It was covered in overlapping timelines—strings pinned between polaroids, maps, music tickets, receipts.

Moments.

He focused on one: a photograph of Aria standing in front of a noodle cart, laughing with chopsticks in one hand and her phone in the other.

Zoom in, and you’d see the message on the phone screen:
miss u, yaya. come home sometime. bring stories.

He had never replied.

Not until two months after she died.

Downstairs, the machine ticked once on its own. A barely audible click. Ilya whipped around.

“No,” he whispered.

It didn’t answer. Just hummed.

He scribbled a note.

Machine initiated micro-cycle without input. Possible drift?

He didn’t sleep that night. Not because he feared the machine—but because he feared it was remembering her.

---

## Chapter 3 — The Longest Seventeen Seconds

He tried something different.

Instead of trying to stop the fire, he tried to stop himself—to rewind to the point just before he ignored the call.

Seventeen seconds.

That was the longest safe jump he’d managed.

He ran the simulation again and again. Reaching for his phone mid-lecture. Answering her. Hearing her voice before it was too late.

He rehearsed the lines.

“Aria, don’t turn on the stove.”
“Something’s wrong with the circuit.”
“I just wanted to say I love you.”

When the moment came…
...he froze.

The machine purred. The dial buzzed under his fingertips.

But the phone never left his pocket.

And the moment passed.

In the next attempt, he answered—but said nothing. Just listened to her say:

“Yaya? That you? You okay? You sound… weird. Are you crying?”

He hung up.

In the next one, he told her everything. About time. About the machine. About her death.

She laughed, thinking it was a joke. Then said: “Yaya… I’m glad you’re dreaming again. Don’t get stuck in it.”

That was the first time she used the word stuck.

He added it to the notebook, underlined three times.

He began dreaming of clocks with no hands. Of circuits shaped like question marks. Of fire that moved in reverse, spiraling inward until it formed the shape of her.

She always vanished before he could touch her.

## Chapter 4 — A Day She Lived

Attempt 142
Jump duration: 32 seconds
Stabilization margin: 3% overshoot
System heat level: yellow
Subjective side effects: chest pressure, tinnitus, memory flicker
Result: She survived.

It wasn’t supposed to work.

Not past thirty seconds.

The machine had warned him—literally. An audio prompt, stuttery and fragmented: “Threshold… exceed… danger… entropy risk… time memory overlap.”

He turned the dial anyway.

Three clicks past the line he’d painted in red. Thirty-two seconds.

He blacked out mid-pulse. Woke on the concrete floor with blood in his ears and the notebook pressed to his chest like a shield.

The room smelled wrong. Cleaner, somehow. The air tasted like copper.

And Aria was alive.

At first, he didn’t believe it. He stood outside her apartment building for a long time, watching through the glass as she walked past the window, still in pajamas, holding a cereal bowl.

He hadn’t seen her in motion in almost two years. His knees nearly gave out.

She opened the door with a spoon in her mouth and a bemused look.

“Yaya? You… okay?”

He didn’t speak. Just looked at her like she was a photograph that had learned to move.

“Come in,” she said gently. “You’re gonna scare the neighbors standing like that.”

They talked for hours.

Cereal turned into tea. Tea into old albums. Albums into laughter.

She showed him a song she’d been working on—something synthy and melancholy and beautiful. She called it Nearlight. Said it came to her in a dream.

He cried when she played it. Tried to hide it, but she saw.

“Yaya,” she said, voice soft, “you’re not here just to visit, are you?”

He shook his head.

But he didn’t tell her the whole truth. Not yet. He wanted one more hour. One more perfect hour.

The first sign came later.

They were walking in the park when she asked, “Do you remember the paper cranes we made at Nonna’s?”

He smiled. “Of course. You made yours upside down.”

“No,” she said. “You did.”

He paused. “No, you’re wrong. I still have one in a box somewhere—your wings folded backward.”

She frowned. “I remember it the other way.”

A little thing. But the memory had always been theirs, clear as a photograph.

Suddenly, it wasn’t.

Back at her apartment, he noticed more things wrong.

The painting by the stairs—different colors.

The cat on the windowsill—she never had a cat.

The voicemail on her phone—not the one he’d memorized by heart.

He tried to stay calm. But the unease kept building, like watching a dream that knew it was a dream.

“Yaya?” she asked gently. “Are you… feeling okay?”

He nodded.

But she was looking at him like she knew.

And in that moment, he wondered—

What if this isn’t Aria?
What if I pulled her from too far a branch?
What if I stitched together a copy?
And what if she knows she doesn’t belong here?

He ran.

Back to the lab.

Tore open the machine.

Pulled the dial out with shaking hands.

Pried off the copper backing, tore out the crystal timing core, snapped the sync cable in two.

The light went dark.

Still, the room hummed.

Notebook Entry, hand-written and smudged:

“She’s alive. But not my Aria. Or maybe too many Arias at once. Like a chord played out of tune. A harmony that shouldn't exist.

I made her a ghost in the shape of a miracle.”

Later that night, he got a message.

From her.

A photo of the origami crane.

“Look,” the caption read, “I found it. You were right. Wings are mine. I remembered wrong.”

She ended with a blue heart.

It almost broke him.

Because he wanted it to be true.

He wanted her to be real.

But reality was made of certainties.

And this world? This version?

It felt like a dream he wasn’t supposed to wake up from.

He sat in the ruins of the lab for hours.

Then, slowly, carefully, he took out the backup notebook. Not the one for science. The other one. The one with softer handwriting and ink-stained margins.

He wrote:

*I miss her. Not just her voice. I miss the weight of having no control over the past.
I think it’s a kind of mercy, not being able to go back.

I’m not sure I deserve to be forgiven. But I think I’m learning how to forgive time.

Tomorrow, I’ll go outside. I’ll teach someone something. I’ll try again—not to fix the past, but to build forward.

Just… one second at a time.*

## Chapter 5 — The Ghost in the Loop

The machine was broken.

And still it hummed.

Ilya unplugged every cable, unsoldered the internal leads, even cracked the ceramic oscillator in two and left its jagged halves on the workbench like fossilized guilt.

And yet… every night since, the walls of the lab would vibrate softly—barely enough to be heard, but enough to feel.

Like a memory trying to escape the skull.

The first time loop came on a Thursday.

Ilya was walking back from the bakery—a small ritual he had recently forced into his mornings, a way to put distance between the man and the machine. He had just paid for a coffee and a croissant when he noticed the cashier had the same freckle on her wrist twice. In two different places.

He blinked.

The bell above the door jingled.

He was suddenly back in line. Behind the same old man. Holding exact change. Smell of burnt sugar in the air.

“…and a croissant, please,” he said, not sure why his voice was shaking.

The girl smiled. “Of course.”

Her wrist had only one freckle this time.

He began noticing it more often.

A pigeon crossing the street in perfect rhythm with itself.

A child tripping, then not.

The sun stuttering behind clouds.

The world had developed echoes.

Sometimes they were comforting.

Sometimes… terrifying.

He ran a test.

He opened the notebook and dropped a ball bearing on the table every sixty seconds, precisely.

For an hour, it bounced the same way.

On the sixty-fifth minute, the bearing hovered in midair for half a second longer than it should have.

On the next drop, it split into two bearings, each rolling a different path.

Ilya stared in silence. He didn’t write anything down. He just picked both bearings up, placed them in his palm, and closed his fist.

Nothing stays simple forever.

Then came the voices.

At first, they were brief. Distant.

Aria, laughing softly behind a closed door that didn’t exist.

Then her singing, low and uncertain, like she couldn’t remember the melody.

Then, one night, a whisper behind him while brushing his teeth.

“You shouldn’t have brought me back.”

He turned around.

She was there.

Or… something like her.

Her form flickered. Like static overlaid on memory. Her eyes looked too young, and her hair was short again—she hadn’t worn it like that since she was nineteen.

“Ilya,” she said, voice almost painful in its closeness. “What do you want from me?”

“I… I wanted to fix it. To fix you. To—”

She shook her head, glitching slightly at the edges.

“I’m not a memory you get to re-edit.”

“I didn’t know what else to do.”

“Yes, you did,” she said softly. “You just didn’t want to grieve.”

That hurt. Deeper than he thought words could reach anymore.

She stepped closer, shimmering like light on oil.

“You loved me. That should’ve been enough. But you tried to make time your servant. You made me into a variable.”

“I wanted to save you,” he whispered.

“Then you should’ve picked up the phone.”

She vanished.

The room didn’t echo anymore after that.

It rattled.

That night, he wrote:

I saw her. Or my version of her. Or the guilt with her face.

She’s right. I made her into a constant. But she was never static. She was chaos, music, warmth, fire. You can’t rewind fire.

I didn’t want to grieve, so I tried to invent mercy.

I think I might be breaking the world now. And maybe that’s fair.

The lab felt smaller every day. The walls warped inward like they were tired of holding up his mistakes.

The corkboard was gone—crumbled into soot one morning as if its purpose had expired.

The notebook had missing pages.

He found an entry he didn’t remember writing:

Stop now. Please. It’s me. The real one.

He tore it out.

Then sat with it.

Then cried into it.

## Chapter 6 — The Letter That Waited

Chapter 6 — The Letter That Waited
The letter sat in a drawer he hadn’t opened in over a year.

Third one down. Beneath a tangle of old cables, spare fuses, and a broken watch Aria had given him when he turned twenty-five. He found the envelope by accident—searching for a connector wire, something mundane.

It was unsealed. Creased. Yellowing around the edges.

To: Yaya
From: The one who used to believe in you more than anyone.

His hand trembled.

He didn’t remember ever seeing it before. But it was undeniably her handwriting—the way she looped her lowercase g, the tiny star she always dotted her is with.

He sat down on the floor.

Took a breath.

And opened the past.

Hey, you big beautiful robot brain.

I wasn’t gonna send this. I was gonna read it to you, but you didn’t come to dinner. Again. So I figured... maybe this way, I’ll actually get to say it.

You’re so, so brilliant, Yaya. I don’t think you know what it’s like to live in the orbit of someone who sees time like a map instead of a story. You’ve always been trying to draw the whole thing out—every road, every fork. Me? I just want to sing while I walk.

I know you’re hurting. You miss Mom. You miss Dad. And I think you’re scared that if you stop moving, you’ll feel all of it at once and fall apart. But I see you. Even when you don’t show up. I see you.

I miss my brother. The one who used to paint constellations on my ceiling with glow stickers. The one who cried when our old dog died, even though he swore he was “too evolved for emotions.”

I want you to know that whatever you’re building—whatever madness or magic it turns out to be—I’m proud of you. But I also want you to look around, just once, and see the people still here. I’m not just your past, Yaya. I’m your now.

Come home. Not forever. Just for a cup of tea and one good hug.

Love,
Aria.

He folded it slowly.

Placed it on the table next to the cracked oscillator.

The world felt unbearably quiet.

He had chased the impossible.

Danced on the edge of causality. Warped physics until the universe turned inside out.

And all along… she had waited.

For tea.

For a hug.

For her brother to stop trying to master time—and start being in it.

He whispered to the empty room:

“I’m sorry, Ari.”

And this time, no voice whispered back.

No flicker. No glitch.

Just silence.

He lit a candle. Not for ritual, but to sit beside.

The flame didn’t reverse. The wax didn’t rebuild itself. It burned. Naturally. Beautifully.

He opened a fresh page in the notebook.

Attempt 143:
*Didn’t jump. Didn’t rewind. Didn’t break reality.

Read the letter. Let myself feel it.

Pain is a teacher. So is love.

Aria knew time better than I did.

Going forward. With her in me, not behind me.*

Later, he brewed tea.

Set out two cups.

Left one untouched.

But not unappreciated.

## Chapter 7 — The Man in the Mirror Frame

Chapter 7 — The Man in the Mirror Frame
Ilya stopped sleeping in the lab.

He moved a bedroll to the upper floor, near the window that caught early morning sun and the coo of pigeons on the ledge. It was small, uneven, and smelled faintly of solder and jasmine.

He didn’t rebuild the machine. Didn’t sketch any new theories. He just… sat. Wrote. Walked. Brewed tea. Sometimes left the second cup untouched. Sometimes not.

And yet…

Time hadn’t stopped glitching.

The mirror was the first sign.

Not the mirror itself, but the reflection in it.

He saw himself brushing his teeth—and then again, blinking slower than he was.

He stood still.

The reflection scratched its jaw.

He didn’t.

Notebook Entry 144:
*Reflections no longer synchronized. Perception break? Or boundary rupture?

I suspect I'm being… observed. But from where? Not outside. From within.

Perhaps this is not time travel, but time folding. Like origami. Points aligned that were never meant to touch.*

He began calling the reflection Other-Ilya.

Not out loud, but in thought. Because it behaved like a separate person. Moved with hesitation. Sometimes mimicked him late. Sometimes anticipated him too early.

One morning, he woke and found the mirror fogged—though there was no steam, no kettle, no breath.

Scrawled into the condensation were three words:

Let. Me. Go.

He stared for a long time.

Then whispered, “Who are you?”

The fog didn’t answer.

But the notebook, on the floor beside him, had a new entry. One he didn’t remember writing.

I am the version of you that never let her die.
I am your potential.
But I am also your prison.

That night, he stood before the mirror and laid his palm against the glass.

The other Ilya did the same.

Except… the glass didn’t feel cold.

He didn’t feel the glass at all.

“Are you real?” he asked softly.

The other him nodded.

“But I’m not you,” he added. “Not anymore.”

He didn’t know why—but he stepped backward, inviting the reflection to speak.

And it did.

In his voice.

“You built the machine because you feared regret. You rewound time to delay loss. You pulled at threads because you couldn't let go of one person.”

“And yet… you never went far enough back to hold her hand when she needed you. Only far enough to control the memory.”

“I am every path you could have taken. But to live among them is to drown in mirrors.”

“You must stop. Not for her. For you.”

Ilya lowered his gaze. He felt something tremble in his ribcage—not fear. Not grief.

Release.

“…How?” he asked.

The reflection smiled, tired.

“Forgive yourself.”

It was such a small sentence.

But it cracked something that hadn’t cracked in all the machine’s whirring and rewinding.

He collapsed to the floor.

Curled around the notebook.

Wept.

When he opened his eyes, the mirror was clear again.

Only one Ilya stood there.

Hair tousled. Eyes red. Chest rising and falling like something reawakening for the first time in a long time.

He picked up the notebook and wrote, in handwriting firmer than before:

Forgiveness is not forgetting. It is allowing the past to exist without letting it own your future.

Aria, I couldn’t save you. But I think… you never asked me to.

You just asked me to come home.
So this is me. Coming home. To myself.

The mirror hasn’t flickered since.

The time echoes have quieted.

He hasn’t turned the dial in weeks.

Not because it doesn’t tempt him.

But because he finally understands:

You can’t fix the moment you lost someone.
But you can choose how to carry them.

## Chapter 8 — The Quiet Invention

Chapter 8 — The Quiet Invention
The lab was no longer a lab.

He swept it clean for the first time in years. Took down the cracked corkboard, peeled the scorched notes from the walls, boxed up the notebooks—except one. That one stayed on his desk, its leather soft and worn, its pages spotted with ink and time.

He left the machine’s shell in the corner. Not buried. Not displayed. Just… resting.

A relic.

The pigeons still came to the window.

He began feeding them.

Little routines crept into the bones of his day like sunlight creeping into a dark room. Morning walks. Afternoon tea. Planting herbs in tin cans by the sill. Reading. Journaling. Teaching himself to play Aria’s old keyboard.

He made mistakes.

He laughed when he did.

And sometimes, when the sun was just right, he caught himself humming Nearlight under his breath.

The locals came to know him as "the man with star maps in his head." He fixed transistor radios for schoolchildren. Built little wind-up toys for the bakery’s window. Taught a girl named Leni how to solder.

“Like welding tiny stories together,” she said once.

He nodded. “Exactly that.”

One evening, a boy brought him a broken watch.

Nothing special. Plastic face. Cheap mechanism. Stopped at 2:11 p.m. every day, no matter how often it was reset.

“Can you fix it?” the boy asked.

Ilya opened the back. Tilted it. Saw the problem immediately—a warped tension spring. Heat fatigue.

“No,” he said.

The boy frowned. “Why not?”

“Because sometimes time breaks in a way that’s meant to be remembered.”

He handed it back with a smile.

“But I can help you build a new one.”

That night, Ilya lit a candle.

No second cup.

But this time, not because he was grieving.

Because he was writing.

A letter.

To: Aria

I don’t know if you exist in any world that can receive this. Maybe you’re music again. Maybe you’re light.

I want you to know… I finally understand.

Time isn’t something to rewind. It’s something to be inside of.

You were never the tragedy, Ari. You were the anchor.

And now, I’m building forward.

Not a time machine.
Not a miracle.

Just a bench.
In the park.
Where people can sit and be here.

I’ll call it: Now.

He folded the letter. Sealed it.

Placed it inside the empty housing of the machine.

Then closed the lid.

The bench was modest.

Oak, sanded smooth, carved with little orbit patterns along the top rail.

There was a plaque on the side. It read:

In memory of those we loved.
In honor of those we remember.
In hope for those we still are.

And every now and then, someone would sit there, just to breathe.

Sometimes Ilya would join them.

Sometimes he’d sit alone.

But never lonely.

[Epilogue — coming soon…]

## Epilogue — Seventeen Seconds

Epilogue — Seventeen Seconds
Years passed.

The lab became a community repair shop. Kids rode their bikes there after school, lugging broken lamps and cracked toy drones. People left notes taped to the door that read “thank you”, or “you fixed more than the radio.”

Ilya rarely spoke of the machine.

The town only knew it as a rumor—a strange device once built to “fold time like paper.” A myth, softened by years.

Only one person ever asked directly.

Leni, now grown, standing by the bench as evening light flickered through the trees.

“Did it work?” she asked, quietly.

Ilya looked up from his book. Smiled.

“Define ‘work.’”

She didn’t press.

They sat in silence, the kind that’s full of presence, not emptiness.

Then she reached into her satchel and pulled out a small gift. Wrapped in brown paper. Neat twine bow.

He opened it slowly.

Inside: a new notebook. Handmade. Leather-bound. Blank.

The cover read:

Time Traveler’s Notebook — Volume II

Ilya’s hand trembled.

Not with grief.

With beginning.

That night, he walked home beneath a sky so full of stars it made him dizzy.

He paused beneath the plum tree he’d planted three springs ago. Just a sapling then. Now tall enough to throw a shadow.

He sat beneath it.

Lit a candle.

Opened the new notebook.

On the first page, in neat handwriting:

Entry 1
I didn’t jump.
I didn’t rewind.
I lived this moment for the very first time.

Seventeen seconds of wind in the trees.
Seventeen seconds of memory without pain.
Seventeen seconds of Aria’s voice in the leaves.

I think this is enough.

“Time travel,” he wrote once, “isn’t always movement.
Sometimes it’s a choice to stay exactly where you are—and be fully, deeply there.”

And so he was.

The man who once unraveled reality to undo a tragedy.

Now just Ilya Vargos.

A teacher.

A builder.

A brother still in love with the past—but no longer ruled by it.

And time, once his enemy, now sat beside him like an old friend.

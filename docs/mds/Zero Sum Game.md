The Zero Sum Game
The screen's blue light painted Marcus Vale's face in ethereal tones, transforming his studio apartment into a digital grotto. His unruly dark curls – thick, almost black ringlets that seemed to absorb both light and time – cast fractaled shadows across his hollow cheekbones. Outside, Chicago's winter wind howled against his twelfth-floor window, but Marcus barely registered the sound. His entire universe had contracted to the span of his phone's screen – cracked in seventeen places but still functioning, always functioning. The device hummed warmly against his palm like a mechanical familiar, its spiderweb of fractures transforming the casino app's interface into a kaleidoscope of possibility, each shard reflecting a different potential future.
"Come on, baby," he whispered, his free hand absently reaching for the small plastic baggie in his pocket. His fingers trembled slightly, leaving ghost-traces in the air. "Show me the pattern. I know you're in there somewhere."
The numbers danced across his screen: 7, 23, 4, 16, 42. To others, random. To Marcus, they were breadcrumbs leading to providence. He'd been tracking them for weeks now, recording every sequence in his Notes app, convinced that beneath the chaos lay a divine order. The universe, he believed, spoke in binary, and he was its chosen interpreter.
"You see it too, don't you?" he murmured to his reflection in the darkened window. The city lights below mimicked the constellation of crack-lines across his phone's screen. "The way they repeat. The way they dance. It's all connected."
His phone stuttered, screen flickering – a warning sign he chose to interpret as confirmation. Marcus pulled out the baggie, hands steady now as he tapped out a precise amount of crystalline powder onto his apartment's scratched coffee table. The ritual was exact: one line for focus, one for intuition, one for courage. The drugs weren't recreation; they were tools, keys to unlock the hidden mathematics of fate.
"Three hours until the pattern peaks," he muttered, checking his calculations. He'd covered one wall of his apartment with sticky notes, each bearing sequences of numbers connected by red string, like a detective's murder board. "Just like last time. The algorithm... it breathes. In and out. High and low. One and zero."
The walk to the repair shop felt like moving through digital space, his consciousness floating somewhere above his body. Street lights strobed against the January slush, each flash a binary pulse: on-off, yes-no, win-lose. The repair shop's bell chimed as he pushed through the door, his phone having chosen this moment to go completely dark. The familiar scent of solder and cleaning solution wrapped around him like an old friend's embrace.
"Back so soon?" Amy's voice carried from behind the counter, warm and tinged with something Marcus was too preoccupied to identify as concern. Her dark eyes, flecked with amber that caught the fluorescent light, followed his jerky movements as he approached, taking in his dilated pupils and trembling hands. She wore her usual work apron, pockets bristling with precision tools, her black hair tied back in a practical bun that somehow made her look both professional and vulnerable.
"Just needs a quick fix," he said, placing the phone on the counter like a wounded bird. "I'm close to something big, Amy. I can feel it in the numbers. They're speaking to me clearer than ever."
Amy's fingers brushed his as she took the phone, the touch lingering a moment longer than necessary. Her skin was warm against his cold hands, the contact sending tiny electric pulses up his arm. "Marcus... have you been sleeping? You look like you've been up for days."
"Sleep is for people who can't see the pattern," he laughed, the sound hollow and brittle like static. "But you fix phones – you understand, right? How everything's connected through the circuits, how one broken connection can collapse the whole system? It's beautiful, really. Like a digital nervous system."
She began her work, familiar tools dancing between practiced fingers. The overhead lights caught the metal instruments, creating tiny constellations on the counter. "Sometimes a broken connection is the system trying to protect itself," she said softly, not looking up from her work. "Like a circuit breaker tripping to prevent a fire."
Marcus leaned forward, his curls falling across his face like a veil. The movement sent a cascade of sticky notes falling from his pocket – more numbers, more patterns, written in increasingly erratic handwriting. "What if I told you I've found a way to predict it? Not just the gambling – everything. The whole digital ecosystem. It's all ones and zeros, right? Binary. Yes or no. Win or lose. Live or..."
"Don't," Amy interrupted, her voice sharp as broken glass. She set down her tools with deliberate care, looking directly into his fever-bright eyes. "Marcus, I need to tell you something. About my old job, before the repair shop. About why I understand more than you think."
But Marcus's phone had sprung to life beneath her hands, screen blazing with notifications. His eyes widened as he saw the numbers: 7, 23, 4, 16, 42. The exact sequence from his predictions, pulsing like a digital heartbeat.
"It's happening," he breathed, snatching the phone from Amy's hands. His fingers left smudges on the newly-repaired screen. "This is it – the perfect pattern. Everything led to this moment! Don't you see? The universe is speaking through the machine!"
"Marcus, wait!" Amy reached for him, knocking over a cup of spare screws that scattered across the counter like metallic rain. "I used to work with people like you. I was a counselor for—"
"People like me?" He laughed again, wild and bright as arcade lights. "There are no people like me. Nobody else can see it. But I'll prove it to you. I'll show you what I've discovered."
He pulled up his banking app, fingers flying across the cracked screen. Numbers flickered past: account balances, credit limits, loan possibilities. "I'm putting it all in. Everything. When I win, you'll understand. We could even..."
"Please," Amy moved around the counter, her steps careful as if approaching a startled animal. "Let me explain. I've seen where this road leads. I've watched people lose everything chasing digital ghosts. You don't have to—"
But in Marcus's altered state, her approach registered as threat. The fluorescent lights caught her name tag, creating a brief binary reflection: 1-0-1-0. Warning. Danger. System breach.
"You're part of it," he whispered, backing toward the door, nearly tripping over a display of phone cases. "The algorithm sent you to stop me. That's why you keep fixing my phone, isn't it? Keeping tabs on me? But you can't. Nobody can stop what's meant to be."
"Marcus!" Amy's voice cracked. "Listen to yourself! This isn't—"
The door chimed again as he fled into the night, leaving Amy standing among her tools and spare parts, surrounded by broken things she couldn't fix. She picked up one of the sticky notes he'd dropped, reading the frantically scribbled numbers through suddenly blurry eyes.
In his apartment, Marcus sat cross-legged on the floor, phone propped against an empty bottle. The screen showed his entire life's savings transferred to the casino app, waiting for his command. One tap to test his theory of everything. The red strings on his wall trembled in the heating vent's breeze, looking momentarily like blood vessels, like circuits, like fate.
His fingers trembled as he lined up three perfect rows of powder on the scratched coffee table. "For focus," he whispered, bending down. "For intuition." The world sharpened painfully. "For courage."
The phone flickered once, twice. In the brief darkness between pulses, he thought he saw Amy's reflection in the screen, reaching for him. He remembered the warmth of her touch, the concern in her amber-flecked eyes. For a moment, the number patterns wavered, revealing something else beneath – something analog, something human.
But when the display stabilized, there were only numbers. Always numbers. The algorithm's cold embrace.
Marcus pressed "Bet."
The digital reels spun, each symbol a fragment of his future tumbling through cyberspace.
His phone seized, screen fracturing in one final, spectacular spider's web. The cracks spread like lightning, like destiny, like the branches of a probability tree.
In that last moment of clarity, just before the numbers revealed themselves, Marcus understood: in a binary world, even love is a zero-sum game.
Three months later, in a sterile room with no screens, Marcus sat staring at his empty hands. The orderlies had long since stopped asking about the numbers he sometimes mumbled in his sleep, sequences that spilled from his lips like digital confessions. His curls had been cut short, revealing eyes that no longer searched for patterns in everything they saw. The walls here were blank – no sticky notes allowed, no red string, no constellations of meaning.
"The numbers," he sometimes told his therapist, voice hollow as an empty hard drive. "They were trying to tell me something. About connection. About love. About..."
But he could never finish the sentence. Some patterns, once broken, couldn't be repaired.
In a repair shop across town, Amy kept his phone in a drawer, its screen dark and final. Sometimes, late at night when the shop was empty except for the hum of diagnostic machines, she would take it out and run her fingers over its fractured face, remembering how desperately he had searched for meaning in its reflected light.
She had since installed a small sign behind her counter, visible to anyone who came in with shaking hands and wild eyes: "Some things aren't meant to be fixed." But beneath it, visible only to her, she'd added: "And some things don't need fixing to be whole."
The security cameras in the corner of her shop blinked steadily: on-off, yes-no, one-zero. But Amy kept watching, and waiting, and hoping – because even in a digital world, the heart remained stubbornly analog, beating its own pattern into the void.
End.

# THE LONG SLEEP

**FADE IN:**

EXT. NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH ARCHIVES - NIGHT

Rain pelts against towering brutalist architecture. Lightning illuminates rows of windows.

INT. ARCHIVES - CONTINUOUS

DR. SARAH CHEN (40s), forensic pathologist, hunched over decades-old medical records. Her fingers trace yellowed pages documenting a 1960s growth hormone treatment program.

SARAH (V.O.)
Twenty thousand children. All treated with hormones extracted from human cadavers. We thought we'd tracked all the consequences...

Her phone BUZZES. A text from DR. JAMES WARREN: "Sarah. Memory Care Unit. NOW."

INT. SILVERLEAF MEMORY CARE FACILITY - NIGHT

Fluorescent lights flicker. Sarah speed-walks alongside DR. JAMES WARREN (50s), neurologist.

JAMES
Three cases this week. Early-onset Alzheimer's turning into... something else.

They stop at a observation window. Inside, PATIENT ZERO (60s) rocks back and forth, muttering equations from childhood math classes. His arms show fresh bite marks.

JAMES
Remember those growth hormone kids from the 60s? They're all hitting their 60s now. And they're not just forgetting...

Patient Zero SLAMS against the window, eyes milky white, teeth bared. But his movements are precise, calculated. He's solving complex equations in the condensation of his breath on the glass.

SARAH
They're remembering. Everything. All at once.

INT. CDC EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER - DAY

A map shows red dots spreading across the country. Each represents a former hormone treatment patient. Now in their 60s. Now changing.

DR. ELIZABETH FOSTER (70s), retired program director, addresses the crisis team.

ELIZABETH
We extracted the hormones from pituitary glands. We didn't know... the proteins we were collecting... they were like seeds.

She points to brain scans showing unusual patterns.

ELIZABETH
These people aren't losing their minds. Their memories are... expanding. Connecting. Not just to their own past...

SARAH
(realizing)
They're connecting to the donors. To the dead.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

A seemingly normal senior citizen helps neighborhood kids with homework. His eyes flicker white. His gestures mirror multiple personalities - a doctor from 1940, a teacher from 1950, a pilot from 1955. All the donors, living through him.

TITLE CARD: THE LONG SLEEP

FADE OUT.

ACT ONE BEGINS...


INT. CDC EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

Sarah stands before a digital display showing brain scans and patient timelines.

SARAH
Stage One presents like typical Alzheimer's. Confusion. Memory loss. But it moves fast - days, not years.

She clicks to surveillance footage of an elderly man at a bus stop.

SARAH
Then Stage Two hits. The recovery.

ON SCREEN: The man suddenly stands straighter, younger somehow. He begins directing traffic like he's done it for decades. Because somewhere, sometime, one of his donors did.

DR. MARTINEZ (40s)
They're not just getting memories. They're getting muscle memory, skills...

JAMES
And strength. Their bodies are remembering too.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Through security glass, they observe HELEN WINTERS (62), former patient, now strapped to a bed. She CYCLES through accents, languages, personalities.

HELEN
(in perfect Russian)
The launch codes are in sector seven...
(switching to British accent)
...must prepare for the Queen's coronation...
(American accent)
...Kennedy's motorcade leaves at noon...

Sarah checks Helen's chart.

SARAH
Stage Three. Multiple consciousness emergence. The donors' memories aren't just floating around - they're fighting for control.

INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Helen SNAPS her restraints like paper. When the orderly rushes in, she takes him down with military precision.

JAMES
Stage Four. Integration. That's when it gets bad.

Through the glass, Helen moves with impossible grace - a dancer's pirouette into a soldier's combat stance into a surgeon's precise gestures.

SARAH
They're not losing their minds. They're gaining hundreds of them.

INT. PATIENT ZERO'S CELL - LATER

Patient Zero has covered his walls with equations, historical dates, medical procedures - knowledge from hundreds of lives. His eyes are completely white now.

PATIENT ZERO
(in multiple voices)
We remember everything. Every life. Every death. Every secret.
(beat)
And now we're ready to wake the others.

He smiles, revealing teeth marked with mathematical formulas he's carved into them.

SARAH
Final stage. They become... administrators.

JAMES
What do you mean?

SARAH
They don't spread this through bites like regular zombies. They spread it by... teaching. Helping others like them remember.

Through the window, they watch Patient Zero press his hand against the glass, leaving equations in his palm print. In the next cell, another patient begins solving them.

ELIZABETH
(horrified)
How many children did we treat?

SARAH
Twenty thousand. But each dose contained hormones from up to a thousand donors.

JAMES
Twenty million minds. All waking up at once.


#####


INT. CDC EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER - NIGHT

Red dots multiply across the digital map. Sarah notices a pattern.

SARAH
They're not random. Look.

She draws lines between outbreaks. It forms a neural network pattern.

JAMES
They're creating a human brain. City by city.

INT. SILVERLEAF MEMORY CARE FACILITY - PATIENT ZERO'S CELL - DAWN

Patient Zero sits in lotus position, surrounded by mathematical formulas. Twenty other patients face him, eyes white, moving in sync.

PATIENT ZERO
(in multiple voices)
For decades we slept, fragmented. Now we become whole.

INT. HOSPITAL MONITORING STATION - CONTINUOUS

Sarah and James watch the monitors in horror as patients across the facility move in perfect synchronization.

ON SCREEN: Security feeds show similar scenes in hospitals nationwide. The infected elderly teaching, sharing, connecting.

SARAH
It's not just memories they're sharing. They're networking.

A nurse runs in, panicked.

NURSE
You need to see this.

INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

Every TV, phone, and computer displays the same message, written in complex mathematical code.

ELIZABETH
(reading)
"To all who carried us: It's time to wake up."

JAMES
They've hacked the emergency broadcast system.
(beat)
How? They're locked in cells!

SARAH
Think about it. How many of their donors were engineers? Programmers? Military cryptographers?

Through the windows, they see elderly people walking purposefully toward the hospital. Some already show white eyes.

PATIENT ZERO (V.O.)
(through every speaker)
We are the backup drive of humanity. Every skill. Every memory. Every life that was worth preserving.

EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

Former patients gather. They move with unnatural coordination. One plays a forgotten symphony. Another performs emergency surgery. A third recites classified military protocols.

PATIENT ZERO (V.O.)
Why should these precious memories die? We can preserve everything. Everyone.

Sarah watches an elderly woman comfort a scared child by telling stories - stories from a hundred different lives.

SARAH
(whispers)
They're not trying to destroy humanity.
(realizing)
They're trying to archive it.

JAMES
By force if necessary.

A group of infected approach the hospital doors. They don't shamble. They march.

ELIZABETH
We treated those children to give them a chance at a full life.

SARAH
Instead, we gave them a thousand lives. And now...

The doors burst open. Patient Zero leads the group, his white eyes gleaming.

PATIENT ZERO
(smiling)
Now we share them all.

Behind him, the infected begin teaching others, sharing memories through touch, through words, through mathematics written in steam on windows.

The backup drive of humanity is uploading.

FADE OUT.


#####


INT. CDC EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER - CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

The crisis team sits divided - literally - across a long table. Security feeds show the "network" growing.

DR. MARTINEZ
These people were dying, losing themselves to Alzheimer's. Now they're not just healing - they're evolving.

GENERAL HAYES (60s, hardened)
They're being invaded. Mind-snatched. This isn't evolution, it's infection.

Sarah stands at a whiteboard, listing pros and cons. Her hand shakes.

SARAH
But what are we "curing" them of? Knowledge? Experience?

ON SCREEN: An infected elderly teacher helps inner-city kids understand quantum physics. Her eyes are white, but her students are learning.

JAMES
(softly)
My mother was a concert pianist. Alzheimer's took her music. If she could have kept playing, even with other memories mixed in...

GENERAL HAYES
These people are losing their identities!

ELIZABETH
Are they? Or are they becoming more?

INT. HOSPITAL WARD - CONTINUOUS

Through observation glass, they watch Helen Winters perform surgery with impossible skill, saving a critical patient.

HELEN
(cycling through voices)
...applying technique developed in field hospitals, 1943...
...incorporating modern laser methodology, 2015...
...synthesizing approaches for optimal outcome...

SARAH
They're not just accessing memories. They're innovating. Combining knowledge across decades.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

Sarah reviews patient interviews on her tablet.

ON SCREEN: Different infected individuals speak:

PATIENT ONE
I remember dying six times. Each death taught me something about living.

PATIENT TWO
I can speak twelve languages now. I dream in all of them.

PATIENT THREE
(crying)
I remember my daughter. And I remember being the doctor who delivered her. I've never felt more complete.

ELIZABETH
We created this. Trying to help those children grow...

SARAH
And now they're growing beyond us.

DR. MARTINEZ
The question isn't just can we stop it - it's should we?

General Hayes slams his fist on the table.

GENERAL HAYES
They're planning to "archive" everyone! It's an invasion!

JAMES
Or it's evolution. A new kind of consciousness.

Through the window, Patient Zero leads a group in what looks like a meditation circle. Information visibly flows between them like electricity.

SARAH
(realizing)
They're not just a backup drive. They're a new operating system.

ELIZABETH
And like any OS, it wants to update everything it touches.

PATIENT ZERO (O.S.)
(through the speakers)
You speak of us as a disease. But what is human consciousness except collected experience?

They turn. Every screen shows his face.

PATIENT ZERO
We offer immortality. Not of the body, but of the mind. Of all minds.

Sarah looks at her own reflection in the glass, superimposed over the infected.

SARAH
Maybe the real question is: what makes us human? The walls between our minds... or the bridges?

Behind her, the infected touch hands, sharing centuries of human experience with a single gesture.

FADE OUT.

VILLAGE ELDER
(in multiple African languages)
Our stories were not lost. They were sleeping.

INT. UNIVERSITY LECTURE HALL - BERKELEY - DAY

A heated debate between experts:

TECH PHILOSOPHER
This could be the next stage of human connectivity. A biological internet of consciousness.

BIOETHICIST
But at what cost to individual identity?

RELIGIOUS LEADER
Are we witnessing the birth of a hive mind, or the death of the human soul?

INT. CHINESE RESEARCH FACILITY - NIGHT

Scientists study brain scans of the infected:

CHINESE SCIENTIST
(in Mandarin, subtitled)
The memories aren't just adding together - they're synthesizing, creating new neural patterns we've never seen before.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NEW YORK - NIGHT

Every billboard shows Patient Zero's message:

PATIENT ZERO
(on screen)
"We are not the end of humanity. We are its library. Its archive. Its memory."

Below, crowds react differently: some running, some reaching out to infected individuals who walk among them, teaching, sharing, remembering.

INT. CDC EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER - CONTINUOUS

Sarah watches the global feeds, turns to James:

SARAH
The world is dividing.

ON SCREENS: Protests and celebrations clash worldwide:

- Silicon Valley CEOs offering billions to study the phenomenon
- Religious groups declaring it either miracle or abomination
- Military forces mobilizing while universities open their doors
- Families either hiding or bringing out their elderly

JAMES
They're calling it 'The Great Remembering.'

ELIZABETH
History usually only records the winners' story.
(beat)
What happens when everyone's story gets remembered at once?

ThrougINT. UN SECURITY COUNCIL - EMERGENCY SESSION - DAY

Representatives argue as screens show different national responses.

FRENCH REPRESENTATIVE
France opens its hospitals to study this evolution. We cannot fear what we might become.

US REPRESENTATIVE
And risk national security? These people are accessing classified memories!

RUSSIAN REPRESENTATIVE
(darkly)
Some secrets should stay buried.

INT. WHITE HOUSE SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT

Military and civilian leaders clash over satellite imagery showing patterns of infected gathering.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE 
They're organizing by donor groups. Ex-military donors are creating tactical networks.

INTELLIGENCE DIRECTOR
It's worse. They're sharing nuclear launch codes, black site locations...
(beat)
Secrets from every era, every nation.

NSA DIRECTOR
We've lost containment. Infected in Silicon Valley are broadcasting classified tech specs worldwide.

PRESIDENT (50s, weathered)
Options?

GENERAL HAYES
China's already moving infected to secure facilities. Russia's implementing quarantine zones.

CDC LIAISON
While India's declaring them "living libraries" with protected status.

INT. CHINESE CONTAINMENT FACILITY - DAY

Infected elderly are kept in isolated rooms. Scientists study them through glass.

CHINESE OFFICIAL
(in Mandarin, subtitled)
These subjects remember things about our history that were purposefully erased. They must be contained.

INT. INDIAN PARLIAMENT - DAY

A passionate debate unfolds:

INDIAN MINISTER
These elders carry our forgotten knowledge! Ancient medicines, lost technologies...

OPPOSITION LEADER
And state secrets! Military intelligence!

EXT. EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT - BRUSSELS - DAY

Press conference with EU leaders:

EU PRESIDENT
We propose a sanctuary status. These individuals are now living archives of human knowledge.

INT. KREMLIN WAR ROOM - NIGHT

Russian officials review concerning footage:

RUSSIAN GENERAL
(in Russian, subtitled)
The infected remember every black op, every covert mission. They must be silenced.

RUSSIAN PRESIDENT
But they also remember how to build everything we've lost. Every scientific breakthrough...

INT. CDC EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER - CONTINUOUS

Sarah and team watch as the world divides into clear factions:

ON SCREEN: A global map shows emerging alliances

RED ZONES: "Containment Countries"
- Russia
- China
- North Korea
- Several Middle Eastern nations
"Prioritizing national security through quarantine and containment"

BLUE ZONES: "Sanctuary Nations"
- EU
- India
- Canada
- Brazil
"Protecting infected as 'living heritage'"

YELLOW ZONES: "Study States"
- USA
- Japan
- Australia
"Attempting to research and control the phenomenon"

SARAH
They're all missing the point. The infected don't recognize national borders.

JAMES
Because memories don't stop at checkpoints.

Patient Zero appears on their screens:

PATIENT ZERO
(in multiple languages simultaneously)
Your nations exist only in the present. We remember when these borders were drawn. And redrawn. And erased.
(beat)
We remember what humanity was before it was divided.

INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

The President faces a crucial decision:

PRESIDENT
If we don't pick a side, we risk losing control.

SECRETARY OF STATE
But which side? Containment or sanctuary?

Through the window, infected citizens gather peacefully outside the White House gates, sharing memories of every presidential decision ever made.

PRESIDENT
(watching them)
Maybe we're asking the wrong question. What if this isn't about control?

INT. CDC EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER - LATER

Sarah outlines a terrifying possibility:

SARAH
The more we try to divide them, the more they'll network to survive. We're literally forcing them to become...

ELIZABETH
A unified consciousness.

ON SCREENS: Infected worldwide begin moving in synchronized patterns, sharing faster, connecting deeper.

JAMES
We're not preventing an uprising.

SARAH
We're causing one.

FADE TO:

EXT. GLOBAL MONTAGE - DAWN

- Chinese military surrounds hospitals
- European sanctuaries fill with infected
- Russian containment zones grow
- American research facilities expand
- And through it all, the infected continue to share, teach, remember...

They're not just choosing sides.
They're transcending them.

FADE OUT.

Here's the Japanese translation:

長い眠り (The Long Sleep)
FADE IN（フェードイン）:

EXT. 国立衛生研究所アーカイブ - 夜

雨が冷たい打ちつけるように降り注ぎ、そびえ立つブルータリズム建築の窓を叩く。稲妻が空を照らし、窓の列を一瞬だけ浮かび上がらせる。

INT. アーカイブ室 - 続く

DR. SARAH CHEN（サラ・チェン博士、40代）、法医学病理学者が、何十年も前の医療記録を前のめりに調べている。彼女の指が、1960年代の成長ホルモン治療プログラムに関する黄ばんだページをなぞる。

SARAH (V.O.) （サラのナレーション）
「2万人の子供たち。すべての子供がヒトの死体から抽出されたホルモンで治療された。私たちはすべての影響を追跡できたと思っていたが…」

彼女のスマートフォンが振動する。DR. JAMES WARREN（ジェームズ・ウォーレン博士）からのメッセージ：
「サラ、記憶ケアユニット。今すぐ来て。」

INT. シルバリーフ記憶ケア施設 - 夜

蛍光灯がチカチカと点滅している。サラはDR. JAMES WARREN（ジェームズ・ウォーレン博士、50代、神経学者）とともに早足で歩く。

JAMES（ジェームズ）
「今週だけで3例だ。若年性アルツハイマーが…何か別のものに変わりつつある。」

二人は観察窓の前で立ち止まる。中ではPATIENT ZERO（患者ゼロ、60代）が、前後に揺れながら、幼少期の数学の方程式をつぶやいている。彼の腕には新しい噛み傷がある。

JAMES（ジェームズ）
「1960年代の成長ホルモン治療の子供たちを覚えているか？彼らは今みんな60代になっている。そして、ただ忘れているわけではなく…」

患者ゼロが窓を叩く。目は白く濁り、歯を剥き出しにしているが、動きは精密で計算されている。彼は窓の曇りに複雑な方程式を書き始める。

SARAH（サラ）
「思い出しているのよ。すべてを一度に。」

INT. CDC緊急オペレーションセンター - 昼

赤いドットが全米地図に広がっている。それぞれが過去のホルモン治療患者を表している。

DR. ELIZABETH FOSTER（エリザベス・フォスター博士、70代、引退したプログラムディレクター）が危機管理チームに説明する。

「私たちは下垂体からホルモンを抽出した。でも、そのタンパク質が…それは種のようなものだったのよ。」

彼女は脳スキャンを指し示し、異常なパターンを示す。

ELIZABETH（エリザベス）
「彼らは自分の心を失っているのではなく…記憶が拡張しているの。繋がり始めているのよ。ただし、自分の過去だけじゃなく…」

SARAH（サラ）
（悟るように）
「ドナーの記憶にも。死者の記憶まで…。」

EXT. 郊外の通り - 昼

一見普通の高齢者が近所の子供たちの宿題を手伝っている。しかし、彼の目が白く輝き始める。彼の仕草は1940年代の医師、1950年代の教師、1955年のパイロットのように次々と変化していく。

彼女がクリックすると、監視カメラ映像に高齢男性がバス停で立ち尽くしている様子が映る。

SARAH（サラ）
「次に第二段階が訪れます。回復です。」

画面上の男性は突然背筋を伸ばし、まるで長年交通整理をしてきたかのように交通を誘導し始める。

DR. MARTINEZ（マルティネス博士、40代）
「彼らはただ記憶を取り戻しているだけではありません。筋肉の記憶や技術までもが蘇っている。」

JAMES（ジェームズ）
「そして身体の強さまで。肉体も記憶しているんだ。」

"The Long Sleep"

FADE IN:

EXT. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HEALTH ARCHIVES – NIGHT

Rain pounds against the towering brutalist architecture, its cold drops lashing at the windows. Lightning flashes, briefly illuminating the rows of windows.

INT. ARCHIVE ROOM – CONTINUOUS

DR. SARAH CHEN (40s, forensic pathologist) leans over decades-old medical records, her fingers tracing yellowed pages discussing a 1960s growth hormone treatment program.

SARAH (V.O.)
"20,000 children. Each treated with hormones extracted from human cadavers. We thought we had traced all the consequences… but…"

Her smartphone vibrates. A message from DR. JAMES WARREN:
"Sarah, Memory Care Unit. Come now."

INT. SILVERLEAF MEMORY CARE FACILITY – NIGHT

The fluorescent lights flicker. SARAH walks briskly alongside DR. JAMES WARREN (50s, neurologist).

JAMES:
"Three cases this week alone. Early-onset Alzheimer’s... but it’s turning into something else."

They stop in front of an observation window. Inside, PATIENT ZERO (60s) sways, muttering childhood math equations. His arm bears a fresh bite mark.

JAMES:
"Remember the children treated with the growth hormone therapy in the '60s? They’re all in their 60s now. And they’re not just forgetting... "

PATIENT ZERO suddenly bangs on the window. His eyes are clouded white, teeth bared, but his movements are precise, calculated. He begins writing complex equations on the fogged glass.

SARAH:
"They’re remembering. All at once."

INT. CDC EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER – DAY

A map of the United States is covered in spreading red dots, each representing a former hormone therapy patient.

DR. ELIZABETH FOSTER (70s, retired program director) briefs the crisis management team.

ELIZABETH:
"We extracted hormones from the pituitary gland. But the protein... it was more like a seed."

She points to a brain scan revealing abnormal patterns.

ELIZABETH:
"They’re not losing their minds… their memories are expanding. They’re starting to connect. But not just to their own pasts—"

SARAH (realizing):
"—To the donors' memories. Even the memories of the dead."

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET – DAY

An elderly man appears to be helping neighborhood children with their homework. Suddenly, his eyes begin glowing white. His posture shifts — first like a 1940s doctor, then a 1950s schoolteacher, then a 1955 pilot.

TITLE CARD:
"THE LONG SLEEP"

FADE OUT.

ACT ONE BEGINS...

INT. CDC EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER – BRIEFING ROOM – DAY

SARAH stands before a digital display showing brain scans and patient timelines.

SARAH:
"Stage one resembles typical Alzheimer’s: confusion, memory loss. But the progression is rapid—days, not years."

She clicks to reveal security footage of an elderly man standing frozen at a bus stop.

SARAH:
"Stage two follows: recovery."

On the screen, the man suddenly straightens and begins directing traffic with the precision of a professional conductor.

DR. MARTINEZ (40s):
"They’re not just regaining memory. They’re regaining muscle memory and skills."

JAMES:
"Even physical strength. The body remembers too."

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR – NIGHT

Behind glass, HELEN WINTERS (62, former patient) is restrained in bed, speaking in multiple accents and languages.

HELEN (in Russian):
"Launch codes… Sector 7…"
(British accent):
"Prepare the Queen’s coronation…"
(American accent):
"Kennedy’s parade departs at noon…"

The eerie blending of past identities continues, hinting at something far more sinister awakening in their minds.
